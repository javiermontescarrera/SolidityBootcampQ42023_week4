Voting dApp build by Team 9

## Hw
This is a group activity:

- Complete the projects together with your group
- Create a voting dApp to cast votes, delegate and query results on chain
- Request voting tokens to be minted using the API
- (bonus) Store a list of recent votes in the backend and display that on frontend
- (bonus) Use an oracle to fetch off-chain data to define the proposals instead of passing them in constructor

Voting dApp integration guidelines
Single POST method:
- Request voting tokens from API
- Use these tokens to interact with the tokenized ballot
- All other interactions must be made directly on-chain
